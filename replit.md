# Client Management System for Polish Property Owners in Spain

## Overview

This is a web-based client management system (gestor√≠a) designed to manage Polish clients and their properties in Spain, specifically for handling Modelo 210 tax declarations. The application allows tracking client information, property details, co-ownership arrangements, and different types of property tax declarations (imputation of rent, actual rental income, or mixed).

The system is built as a full-stack TypeScript application with a React frontend and Express backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Core Libraries:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for the UI layer
- Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and data fetching
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation

**UI Component System:**
- Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design system
- Design follows soft, approachable aesthetic with pastel colors (referenced in design_guidelines.md)
- Components configured in "new-york" style variant

**State Management Pattern:**
- Server state managed via React Query with disabled refetching (staleTime: Infinity)
- Form state handled by React Hook Form
- No global client state management library (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- Query invalidation pattern used for cache updates after mutations

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Custom Vite middleware integration for development with HMR
- RESTful API design pattern

**API Structure:**
- `/api/clientes` - Client CRUD operations
- `/api/clientes/:id/propiedades` - Properties by client
- `/api/propiedades/:id` - Individual property operations
- `/api/propiedades/:id/copropietarios` - Co-owner management

**Request/Response Handling:**
- JSON body parsing with raw body preservation
- Zod schema validation on incoming requests
- Standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Request logging middleware for API routes

### Data Layer

**ORM & Database:**
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- PostgreSQL as the database (via Neon serverless driver with WebSocket support)
- Database schema defined in shared/schema.ts for type sharing between client and server

**Schema Design:**
- `clientes` table: Client information (NIE, name, contact details, Polish address)
- `propiedades` table: Property details (cadastral reference, address, purchase info, cadastral values)
- `propiedad_copropietarios` junction table: Co-ownership relationships with percentage shares
- Soft deletion pattern (activo/activa boolean flags)
- Indexed fields for common queries (NIE, client names, declaration types)

**Data Access Pattern:**
- Storage abstraction layer (IStorage interface) in server/storage.ts
- DatabaseStorage implementation handles all database operations
- Supports relationships via Drizzle's query builder and joins

### Build & Development System

**Build Pipeline:**
- Vite for frontend bundling and development server
- esbuild for backend compilation (ESM output)
- TypeScript compilation checking via tsc (noEmit mode)

**Development Features:**
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) via Vite
- Replit-specific plugins (cartographer, dev banner, runtime error overlay)
- Path aliases configured (@/, @shared/, @assets/)

**Production Build:**
- Frontend assets compiled to dist/public
- Backend bundle to dist/index.js
- Single node process serves both static assets and API

### External Dependencies

**Database:**
- Neon serverless PostgreSQL (specified via DATABASE_URL environment variable)
- Connection pooling via @neondatabase/serverless
- WebSocket transport for serverless compatibility

**UI Component Libraries:**
- Radix UI primitives (@radix-ui/*) for accessible component foundations
- Lucide React for icons
- embla-carousel-react for carousels
- cmdk for command palette
- date-fns for date manipulation
- vaul for drawer components

**Form & Validation:**
- React Hook Form for form state management
- Zod for schema validation
- @hookform/resolvers for Zod integration
- drizzle-zod for automatic schema generation from Drizzle models

**Styling:**
- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- class-variance-authority (CVA) for component variants
- clsx and tailwind-merge for class name composition

**Development Tools:**
- tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- drizzle-kit for database migrations
- ws for WebSocket polyfill (required by Neon driver in Node.js)

**Type Safety:**
- Shared schema types between frontend and backend
- Full TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Path mapping for clean imports
